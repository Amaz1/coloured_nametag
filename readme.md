# Coloured Nametag

This mod allows players to set their nametag to a color of their choice.

## Getting started

**Warning:** This mod is useless in singleplayer (even with F7, nametag isn't visible).

Use `/nametag` to change your nametag color.      
A formspec will be opened, so, you can choose a color.

You can use parameters to set a color, too.   
For example, use

      /nametag blue

to set your nametag to color blue.

Players can also change their color to their like using `/custom-nametag` in the RGB format (between 1 and 255).
